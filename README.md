# HUMAN_ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION_USING_SMARTPHONE
DESCRIPTION: This project uses a dataset of accelerometer and gyroscope data collected from 30 subjects performing six different activities. The data is cleaned and preprocessed, and then feature selection is used to identify the most important features for activity recognition. Four machine learning models are trained to classify the activities, and their accuracy is evaluated on a test set.
